last time we did standup

we neneed to change your initiative
i ask you about standup
i ask about job seeker
i ask what are your ideas

d: talking about it stresses me

a: i initiate talks    | stress
b: you initiate talks  | stress

if i don't want to do something i won't
buf if you make me, i'll do it

me initiating the talks
  the only way to get the talks going on
you initating the talks
  unlikely to happen because you feel to stressed to talk about anything


goals

  get job / make money
    jobseeker

why didn't you do jobseeker at the end of the other days?
d: it stresses me out

at the start of the bootcamp i puked everyday before going to school
stress because of what i demand of you

one is important the other isn't
coding challenge isn't important
writing linkedin is important

bootcamp was something new so it stressed me to the point of puking
job seeker stresses me more but not to the point of puking
